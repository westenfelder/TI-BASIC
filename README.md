# TI-BASIC
This is a collection of TI-BASIC programs written for the TI 84 Plus SE/CE.  
TIPTRICK was my first program, written for MathCounts competitions. DYNAMITE Terminal was the next program, offering a simple GUI menu. This evolved into a collection of programs for different subjects unified with a navigation menu. The most complete program is STATS, which offers a suite of tools for the AP Statistics course.
